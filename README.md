# **Secured Quantum Multiparty Communication Protocol for Imperfect Channels Utilizing W-States**

## **Overview**
This project presents a secure multiparty communication protocol leveraging the W-state entanglement in quantum communication to overcome challenges in imperfect channels. The protocol ensures secure key distribution, message encryption, and eavesdropping detection. The integration of a third-party mediator ("Charlie") and decoy photons enhances security, making the system more resilient to noise and external attacks.

## **Features**
- **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD):** Secure key sharing using entangled W-states.
- **Noise Resilience:** Improved tolerance to communication channel imperfections.
- **Eavesdropping Detection:** Integration of decoy photons and statistical analysis to detect intrusions.
- **Multiparty Communication:** Secure and selective message transmission between multiple parties.
- **Third-Party Monitoring:** Charlie acts as a neutral mediator for system integrity.
- **Encryption Security:** AES-128 encryption with SHA-256 hashing.


## **Workflow**

1. **W-State Generation:**  
   A quantum circuit generates W-states using IBM's Qiskit library.  
   
2. **Key Distribution:**  
   - Alice, Bob, and David measure entangled qubits using Z-basis to generate shared secret keys.
   - Charlie anonymously validates key integrity and detects entanglement discrepancies.

3. **Message Encryption & Transmission:**  
   - Alice encrypts messages using AES-128 and transmits them selectively to Bob and/or David using unique tokens.
   - Decoy photons detect eavesdropping by monitoring for disturbances in communication.

4. **Eavesdropping Detection:**  
   - Charlie analyzes entanglement states and decoy photon discrepancies.
   - Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) assessment differentiates noise from security threats.

5. **Security Analysis:**  
   - Resistance to direct measurement and ancilla particle attacks.
   - Evaluation of protocol performance under noise conditions.
